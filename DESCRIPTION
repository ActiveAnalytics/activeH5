Description: This package is written in C/C++ and uses R's reference classes to
    provide an API to read and write large matrices and data frames to disk and
    memory using chunking algorithms. The file format is based on HDF5 but uses
    meta data to store the data frame structure. Any character columns are
    converted to factors. On disk, the data itself is stored as numeric
    matrices and on read-into R it is converted back to data frame.
