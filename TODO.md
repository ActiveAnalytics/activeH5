# TODO List

1.  A head() operation.
2. Chunking in the HDF5 API
3. Use of compression in the HDF5 API
4. In the column selection, instead of reading the whole chunk, read only the columns you require?
5.  Show methods on the functions, some basic meta (not everything) and maybe the head of the data set.
6.  Include read option for RDS files, if class(DF) == "character" check whether it is an RDS file, else read from CSV.
